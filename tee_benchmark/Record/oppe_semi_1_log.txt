Using statistical security parameter 40
No modulus found in /Player-Data//2-Dp-128/Params-Data, generating 128-bit prime
Current working directory: "/root/MP-SPDZ"
Compiler: ./compile.py sigmoid
	4 triples of gfp left
	992 dabits of gfp left
Significant amount of unused dabits of gfp distorting the benchmark. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
