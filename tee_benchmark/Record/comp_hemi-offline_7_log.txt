	7586 triples of gfp left
Significant amount of unused triples of gfp distorting the benchmark. This protocol has a large minimum batch size, which makes this unavoidable for small programs.
	728 bits of gfp left
Significant amount of unused bits of gfp distorting the benchmark. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
